# code challenge 08

## challenge

Write a function called zipLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1)

## approach and efficiency

I attempted TDD but was having an unresolved weird bug with tests so I started writing the code.
it should be O1 for space and time
