# Insertion Sort

## Challenge

Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Insertion Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Approach and Efficiency

the appraoch is iterative and the efficiency is n(n) for time where n is the length of the array
